This addon adds the console command `tmc_togglemousecursor` which enables free mouse cursor movement without moving the crosshair. You can then bind a key to this console command to toggle mouse cursor movement.

This is useful for scenarios which require precise mouse movement, as opposed to the crosshair which is locked to mouse sensitivity. 

Every time this command runs, you will hear a sound and receive a notification at the center of your crosshair. You can enable or disable notifications with `tmc_notifications`.
